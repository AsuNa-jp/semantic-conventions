    attributes:

        brief: >
          Time when the file was last accessed, in ISO 8601 format.

          Array of file attributes.
        note: >
          Attributes names depend on the OS or file system. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of values expected for this
          attribute: `archive`, `compressed`, `directory`, `encrypted`, `execute`, `hidden`, `immutable`, `journaled`, `read`, `readonly`, `symbolic link`, `system`, `temporary`, `write`.

          Time when the file attributes or metadata was last changed, in ISO 8601 format.
        note: >
          `file.changed` captures the time when any of the file's properties or attributes
          (including the content) are changed, while `file.modified` captures the timestamp
          when the file content is modified.

      - id: file.directory

        examples: ['png', 'gz']

          When the file name has multiple extensions (example.tar.gz), only the last one should
          be captured ("gz", not "tar.gz").
      - id: file.fork_name
        type: string
        brief: >
          Name of the fork. A fork is additional data associated with a filesystem object.
        note: >
          On Linux, a resource fork is used to store additional data with a filesystem object. A file always has at
          least one fork for the data portion, and additional forks may exist.

          On NTFS, this is analogous to an Alternate Data Stream (ADS), and the default data stream for a file is
          just called $DATA. Zone.Identifier is commonly used by Windows to track contents downloaded from the Internet.
          An ADS is typically of the form: C:\path\to\filename.extension:some_fork_name, and some_fork_name is the
          value that should populate `fork_name`. `filename.extension` should populate `file.name`, and `extension`
          should populate `file.extension`. The full path, `file.path`, will include the fork name.

          The URL of the webpage that linked to the file.
        note: >
          This information comes from metadata or alternate data streams linked to the file.
          `file.origin_url` represents the URL from which the file was downloaded, and `file.origin_referrer_url`
          indicates the URL of the page where that URL was listed. There may be cases where both `file.origin_url`
          and `file.origin_referrer_url` exist, or only one of them is present. Note that the URL itself may contain
          sensitive information.

        brief: >
          Windows Zone Identifier for the file.
        note: >
          Zone Identifier (ZoneID) is a numerical identifier that shows where
          (what "Zone") a file came from, helping to decide if it's safe to open.
          The commonly used predefined Zones in Windows and their IDs are as follows:
          Zone 0: Local Machine Zone
          Zone 1: Local Intranet Zone
          Zone 2: Trusted Sites Zone
          Zone 3: Internet Zone
          Zone 4: Restricted Site Zone
